    <section>
        <p>This is the second in a series of posts on how I currently maintain my academic website (<a href="https://github.com/brianbuccola/mcgill-website">here</a>). In the <a href="../maintaining-an-academic-website-part-1-editing-the-site/">first post</a>, I explained how I write and edit my site using the simple and intuitive syntax of <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">markdown</a>, rather than pure HTML, and convert from markdown to HTML using <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/">pandoc</a>. I also explained how I modularize my website into (i) main content, the stuff written in markdown, which evolves over time, and (ii) metacontent, which is kept in separate header, footer, etc. files, which is more static; and I showed how pandoc can combine all such content into one standalone HTML page. I gave a pretty basic script for automating all that each time any part of the site is edited.</p>
<p>In this post I’ll explain how to automate another important aspect of site maintenance: pushing the website from your local PC to the remote server hosting the website, e.g., a university server (McGill’s, in my case). For this task, we’ll be using <a href="http://www.openssh.org/">ssh</a> and <a href="http://rsync.samba.org/">rsync</a>.</p>

<h2 id="pushing-to-server">Pushing to server</h2>
<p>Alright, so you’ve got a website all set up, and the directory structure looks something like this.</p>
<pre><code>after-body.html
before-body.html
favicon.png
files
    \--- handout-stuff.pdf
    \--- handout-junk.pdf
header.html
images
    \--- pic-of-me.jpg
index.html
index.markdown
md2html
mystyle.css</code></pre>
<p>(Most of these files are optional; all you really need is <code>index.markdown</code>, <code>index.html</code>, and <code>md2htmlsh</code>. But for completeness, I’ll assume we’re dealing with a CSS stylesheet, some images, downloadable files, etc.)</p>
<p>Essentially, we want to transfer the all necessary website components from a local PC location to a remote server. The way we do this is with ssh (actually, the suite of utilities provided by OpenSSH, including <code>ssh</code> and <code>scp</code> (secure copy).)</p>
<h3 id="ssh">SSH</h3>
<p>You know, instead of talking about “you” or “me”, it’ll be easier to talk about a hypothetical third person. Meet Bob. Bob’s website is located on his PC in the directory <code>/home/bob/website</code>. Bob attends ABC University, which has been kind enough to give Bob some server space for his website. They also tell Bob he can access his server space remotely using “secure shell access”.</p>
<p>What this means is that, while Bob is sitting on his couch in his apartment on his own PC, he can access/log onto his university server. How so? With <a href="http://www.openssh.org/">ssh</a>, a secure access utility provided OpenSSH.</p>
<h4 id="sshing-manually">ssh–ing manually</h4>
<p>Let’s assume that Bob’s university login name is <code>bob22</code>, because he’s the 22nd Bob, and so his login name is <code>bob22@abc.edu</code>. Then he can access the server with the following simple command (recall that <code>$</code> is the command–line prompt; don’t type it):</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-1" title="1">$ <span class="fu">ssh</span> bob22@abc.edu</a></code></pre></div>
<p>Pretty easy. After executing this command, Bob will be prompted for his university password, which happens to be <code>iluvssh</code> (but don’t tell anyone). He enters the password and is greeted with something like:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-1" title="1"><span class="ex">Welcome</span> to the ABC University server! Blah blah blah, GNU/Linux license</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-2" title="2"><span class="ex">stuff</span>, no warranty, yada yada.</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-3" title="3"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-4" title="4"><span class="ex">bob22@abc</span>:~$</a></code></pre></div>
<p>Bob went from being inside his personal home directory to being on his home directory on his uni server, hence why <code>$</code> is the prompt in both cases. Note, however, that Bob’s local home directory is <code>/home/bob</code>, whereis his remote uni one is (probably) <code>/home/bob22</code>.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb4-1" title="1"><span class="ex">bob22@abc</span>:~$ echo <span class="va">$HOME</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb4-2" title="2"><span class="ex">/home/bob22</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>Bob looks around in his home directory, and he notices two folders:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb5-1" title="1"><span class="ex">bob22@abc</span>:~$ ls</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb5-2" title="2"><span class="ex">private</span> public_html</a></code></pre></div>
<p>Presumably, <code>private</code> is for stuff that no other students/users of that server has access to; <code>public_html</code> is where Bob needs to put his website. But how does he do that? Right now, he’s “inside” his uni home, with no way look at his PC home, except in another shell, but then in that shell he would have no way to look at his uni home. That is, the two shells could not “communicate”, as it were.</p>
<h4 id="scp">scp</h4>
<p>Enter <code>scp</code>, or secure copy. First Bob exits from his uni server with <code>exit</code>, putting him back into his ordinary PC home. Now he can do this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb6-1" title="1">$ <span class="fu">scp</span> ~/website/index.html bob22@abc.edu:/home/bob22/public_html</a></code></pre></div>
<p>This command (securely) copies the file <code>index.html</code> from the local home directory, <code>/home/bob</code>, over to Bob’s university home directory, <code>/home/bob22</code>, and into the <code>public_html</code> directory.</p>
<p>But there’s a snag: Bob has to enter his password again. How annoying. In fact, each time Bob runs <code>ssh</code> or <code>scp</code>, he has to enter his password. If only there were a way for Bob’s uni server to recognize that it’s <em>Bob</em> (or Bob’s PC) requesting access, so that Bob doesn’t always have to type <code>iluvssh</code>.</p>
<h4 id="ssh-keys">ssh keys</h4>
<p>Well, there is a way: ssh identity files (or keys). Basically, Bob generates a pair of keys—one private, which he keeps on his PC, and one public, which he sends over to the server. The server, since it has Bob’s public key, can recognize and grant access to anyone having Bob’s private key. Obviously, Bob should not share the private key (the public one doesn’t matter).</p>
<p>The command for all this is:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb7"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb7-1" title="1">$ <span class="fu">ssh-keygen</span> -f abc -t rsa -C <span class="st">'ABC University'</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>Legend:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>-f</code> specifies the outut <strong>f</strong>ilename.</li>
<li><code>-t</code> specifies the encryption <strong>t</strong>ype. I use RSA, but DSA is fine too.</li>
<li><code>-C</code> is an optional <strong>c</strong>omment; use it to describe what the key is for.</li>
</ul>
<p>(You’ll be asked to specify a passphrase, which is optional.)</p>
<p>After running this command, Bob has two files: <code>abc</code>, his personal identity file, and <code>abc.pub</code>, the public one. He should first put <code>abc</code> into the directory <code>~/.ssh</code>, where any other keys are located, too:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb8"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb8-1" title="1">$ <span class="fu">mkdir</span> ~/.ssh <span class="co"># create this directory, if not already existing</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb8-2" title="2">$ <span class="fu">mv</span> abc ~/.ssh/</a></code></pre></div>
<p>(Bob could also have simply run <code>ssh-keygen</code> from inside <code>~/.ssh</code> to begin with.)</p>
<p>Now he needs to get <code>abc.pub</code> onto the remote server. That’s easy:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb9"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb9-1" title="1">$ <span class="fu">scp</span> ~/abc.pub bob22@abc.edu:/home/bob22</a></code></pre></div>
<p>But that’s not quite enough. The way OpenSSH works is that the public key has to be concatenated to a file <code>authorized_keys</code>, located in the remote <code>~/.ssh</code>, which contains all public keys needed by Bob’s remote server. To do that, Bob must ssh one more time onto the server, create <code>~/.ssh</code> if necessary, append <code>abc.pub</code> to <code>authorized_keys</code>, change the permissions on <code>authorized_keys</code> so that only Bob can read and write to it, and finally delete <code>abc.pub</code>.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb10"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb10-1" title="1">$ <span class="fu">ssh</span> bob22@abc.edu</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb10-2" title="2"><span class="ex">Welcome</span>! ...</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb10-3" title="3"><span class="ex">bob22@abc</span>:~$ ls</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb10-4" title="4"><span class="ex">abc.pub</span> private public_html</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb10-5" title="5"><span class="ex">bob22@abc</span>:~$ mkdir ~/.ssh</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb10-6" title="6"><span class="ex">bob22@abc</span>:~$ cat ~/abc.pub <span class="op">&gt;&gt;</span> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb10-7" title="7"><span class="ex">bob22@abc</span>:~$ chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb10-8" title="8"><span class="ex">bob22@abc</span>:~$ rm abc.pub</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb10-9" title="9"><span class="ex">bob22@abc</span>:~$ exit</a></code></pre></div>
<p>If all went well, Bob should now be able to ssh onto the server without typing <code>iluvssh</code> every time. Cool!</p>
<h4 id="ssh-config-file">ssh config file</h4>
<p>But there’s another snag: What if Bob’s username were actually</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb11"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb11-1" title="1"><span class="ex">reallylongfirstname.superlonglastname946537</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>and/or what if his university’s domain name were actually</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb12"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb12-1" title="1"><span class="ex">abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz@abc.de.fghi.jklm.no.pqrst.uvwx.yz.edu</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>It’d be pretty annoying to type all that out every time Bob wanted to <code>ssh</code> onto the server or <code>scp</code> something over to it. Sure, Bob could create a shell alias for it, but ssh offers an easy solution: an ssh config file. Bob can simply create a file <code>~/.ssh/config</code> that looks like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb13"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb13-1" title="1"><span class="ex">Host</span> abc</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb13-2" title="2">    <span class="ex">User</span> bob22</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb13-3" title="3">    <span class="ex">HostName</span> abc.edu</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb13-4" title="4">    <span class="ex">IdentityFile</span> ~/.ssh/abc</a></code></pre></div>
<p>The keywords are pretty straightforward. The only one worth discussing is <code>Host</code>: this is the name that this particular entry goes by, and it’s that name which, when used in a shell or script, is equivalent to <code>bob22@abc.edu</code>. In other words, typing</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb14"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb14-1" title="1">$ <span class="fu">ssh</span> abc</a></code></pre></div>
<p>is equivalent to typing</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb15"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb15-1" title="1">$ <span class="fu">ssh</span> bob22@abc.edu</a></code></pre></div>
<p>Similarly, typing</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb16"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb16-1" title="1">$ <span class="fu">scp</span> blah.txt abc:/home/bob22</a></code></pre></div>
<p>is equivalent to typing</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb17"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb17-1" title="1">$ <span class="fu">scp</span> blah.txt bob22@abc.edu:/home/bob22</a></code></pre></div>
<p>You can see how a config file drastically simplifies things.</p>
<p>Now all Bob has to do is <code>scp</code> over all the necessary website files. He could do this manually, or write a script. If he wrote a script, then any time he edited or added a file locally, he could then run the script to update the remote website directory. However, if I’m not mistaken, <em>all</em> files, even those untouched, would be copied over every time. There may be a smart way to use <code>scp</code> to handle this problem, but in any case, I prefer rsync for all major copying/backing up of anything.</p>
<h3 id="rsync">Rsync</h3>
<p>Rsync is a great tool for copying or backing up data. Here are some advantages that it has over <code>scp</code>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>It’s smart enough to skip transferring files that are “the same”, in some sense, on the local and remote machines: e.g., if they have the same name and size, and/or same last edit timestamp, and/or same md5sum check, etc.</li>
<li>When it copies over files that have been changed, it only transfers the changes, which speeds things up dramatically.</li>
<li>It allows you to specify an “exclude” file that lists files it should exclude from transfer. (Conversely, you can specify an “include” file that lists the <em>only</em> files that should be transferred.)</li>
<li>Importantly for our (or Bob’s) purposes, it seamlessly integrates ssh.</li>
</ol>
<p>…and so forth.</p>
<p>Since this post is already pretty long, I’ll wrap up with a simple rsync script called <code>push-website</code>, stored in Bob’s <code>~/website</code> directory, which transfers Bob’s website from his local PC to his remote server’s <code>public_html</code> directory. It integrates an include file as well as a log file, both of which are stored in a (hidden) directory <code>~/website/.push-website</code>.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb18"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb18-1" title="1"><span class="co">#!/bin/bash</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb18-2" title="2"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb18-3" title="3"><span class="va">SRC=</span><span class="st">&quot;</span><span class="va">$HOME</span><span class="st">/website&quot;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb18-4" title="4"><span class="va">DEST=</span><span class="st">&quot;abc:/home/bob22/public_html&quot;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb18-5" title="5"><span class="va">EXCL=</span><span class="st">&quot;</span><span class="va">$SRC</span><span class="st">/.push-website/exclude-list&quot;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb18-6" title="6"><span class="va">LOG=</span><span class="st">&quot;</span><span class="va">$SRC</span><span class="st">/.push-website/log&quot;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb18-7" title="7"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb18-8" title="8"><span class="fu">rsync</span> \</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb18-9" title="9">    -avhhh \</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb18-10" title="10">    --exclude-from=<span class="va">$EXCL</span> \</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb18-11" title="11">    --log-file=<span class="va">$LOG</span> \</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb18-12" title="12">    <span class="va">$SRC</span>/ <span class="va">$DEST</span>/</a></code></pre></div>
<p>Legend:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>-a</code> means <strong>a</strong>rchive.</li>
<li><code>-v</code> means <strong>v</strong>erbose (make rsync say what it’s doing while it runs).</li>
<li><code>-hhh</code> means extra <strong>h</strong>uman readable, e.g., “2M” instead of “2000”.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important.</strong> The forward slash, <code>/</code>, in <code>$SRC/</code> is crucial. It tells rsync to transfer the <em>contents</em> of the source directory into the destination directory, rather than transfering <code>$SRC</code> itself. See <code>man rsync</code> for more info. It’s useful to read about all the rsync options.</p>
<p>So now Bob can update his site very simply by editing <code>index.markdown</code>, running <code>md2html</code> to convert to HTML, and running <code>push-website</code> to push the changes to his university server.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb19"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb19-1" title="1"><span class="ex">~/website</span> $ vim index.markdown      # edit, edit, edit, save, quit</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb19-2" title="2"><span class="ex">~/website</span> $ ./md2html               # convert to HTML</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb19-3" title="3"><span class="ex">~/website</span> $ ./push-website          # push changes to remote server</a></code></pre></div>
<p>Nice! By the way, here are some things that are good to keep in the exclude file:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>index.markdown</code></li>
<li><code>header.html</code></li>
<li><code>before-body.html</code></li>
<li><code>after-body.html</code></li>
<li><code>footer.html</code></li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of that is already integrated into <code>index.html</code> when <code>md2html</code> is executed. In fact, you also don’t need to transfer over <code>md2html</code> or <code>push-website</code> either, or the directory <code>.push-website</code>.</p>
<p>Really, you just need to transfer the main HTML file <code>index.html</code>, the stylesheet <code>mystyle.css</code>, and any downloadables, like stuff in <code>images/</code> and <code>files/</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Important.</strong> Make sure that the permissions of all files are properly set on the remote server. In particular, things that you want to be viewed (pages, images) or downloaded (files) must allow read and (maybe) execute privileges set. If an image fails to show up, or if clicking a link lands you on a “Forbidden” page, then the permissions are not set right.</p>
<p>In the last part of this series, I’ll explain how to version control your website, scripts, etc. using git and GitHub. The setup will be a lot like the above, because sites like GitHub and BitBucket use ssh for remote access. We’ll simply generate a new ssh key pair, plop the public one onto GitHub, and add a github entry in <code>~/.ssh/config</code>. Easy stuff.</p>
