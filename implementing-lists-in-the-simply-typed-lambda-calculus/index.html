    <section>
        <p>One of my goals this summer is to re-read Bob Carpenter’s <em>Type-Logical Grammar</em> and to actually do (at least some of) the exercises. If I manage to follow through with that goal, I’ll write up my solutions (or attempts at solutions) to some of the more interesting or difficult exercises. I’ll start that off with the last exercise from Chapter 2, which says to add to the simply typed lambda calculus the type <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^*\)</span> for lists of objects of type <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>. First, let me review Chapter 2 to set the stage.</p>
<h2 id="review">Review</h2>
<p>Chapter 2 deals with the syntax, semantics, and proof theory of the simply typed lambda calculus. I’ll review here the syntax and semantics, but not the proof theory.</p>
<h3 id="syntax">Syntax</h3>
<p>Carpenter builds up the set <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{Typ}\)</span> of types inductively from a set <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{BasTyp}\)</span> of <em>basic types</em>, using just one type constructor: <span class="math inline">\(\to\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Definition (types).</strong> The set of <em>types</em> is the smallest set <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{Typ}\)</span> such that</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{BasTyp} \subseteq \mathbf{Typ}\)</span>.</li>
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(\sigma, \tau \in \mathbf{Typ}\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\((\sigma \to \tau) \in \mathbf{Typ}\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>A type of the form <span class="math inline">\((\sigma \to \tau)\)</span> is called a <em>functional type</em>.</p>
<p>For each type <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span>, there is a set <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{Var}_\tau\)</span> of variables of type <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> and a set <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{Con}_\tau\)</span> of constants of type <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span>. The set of lambda terms of type <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> is defined as follows.</p>
<p><strong>Definition (terms).</strong> The set of <em>(lambda) terms</em> of type <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> is the smallest set <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{Term}_\tau\)</span> such that</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{Var}_\tau \subseteq \mathbf{Term}_\tau\)</span>.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{Con_\tau} \subseteq \mathbf{Term}_\tau\)</span>.</li>
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(\alpha \in \mathbf{Term}_{\sigma \to \tau}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta \in \mathbf{Term}_\sigma\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\((\alpha(\beta)) \in \mathbf{Term}_\tau\)</span>.</li>
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(\tau = \sigma \to \rho\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x \in \mathbf{Var}_\sigma\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\alpha \in \mathbf{Term}_\rho\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(\lambda x . (\alpha) \in \mathbf{Term}_\tau\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>A term of the form <span class="math inline">\((\alpha(\beta))\)</span>, usually abbreviated <span class="math inline">\(\alpha(\beta)\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\ \beta\)</span>, is a <em>functional application</em> of <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>. However, a term <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> with a functional type <span class="math inline">\((\sigma \to \tau)\)</span> is not a function per se—<span class="math inline">\(\alpha(\beta)\)</span> is (the result of) a <em>syntactic</em> operation more akin to term concatenation than functional application. Nevertheless, <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> is called functional (it has a functional type) because of how it is <em>interpreted semantically</em> (model theoretically).</p>
<h3 id="semantics">Semantics</h3>
<p>In the model theory, functional terms denote functions in the normal mathematical sense. Before defining denotations, I need to define frames and models.</p>
<p><strong>Definition (frame).</strong> A <em>frame</em> for the set <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{BasTyp}\)</span> is a collection <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{Dom} = \bigcup\mathbf{Dom}_\tau\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(\tau \in \mathbf{BasTyp}\)</span>) of <em>basic domains</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Definition (model).</strong> A <em>model</em> is a pair <span class="math inline">\(\langle \mathbf{Dom},I \rangle\)</span> in which <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{Dom}\)</span> is a frame, and <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> is the <em>interpretation function</em> mapping constants to the appropriate domain, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(I(\alpha) \in \mathbf{Dom}_\tau\)</span> if <span class="math inline">\(\alpha \in \textbf{Con}_\tau\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Definition (denotation).</strong> Given a model <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{M} = \langle \textbf{Dom}, I \rangle\)</span> and a variable assignment <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>, the <em>denotation</em> <span class="math inline">\([\![\alpha]\!]^\theta_\mathcal{M}\)</span> of a term <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> with respect to <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{M}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> is given by:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(\alpha \in \mathbf{Var}_\tau\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\([\![\alpha]\!]^\theta_\mathcal{M} = \theta(\alpha)\)</span>.</li>
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(\alpha \in \mathbf{Con}_\tau\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\([\![\alpha]\!]^\theta_\mathcal{M} = I(\alpha)\)</span>.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\([\![\alpha(\beta)]\!]^\theta_\mathcal{M} = [\![\alpha]\!]^\theta_\mathcal{M} ([\![\beta]\!]^\theta_\mathcal{M}]\!])\)</span>, assuming <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> are appropriately typed.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\([\![\lambda x . \alpha]\!]^\theta_\mathcal{M} = f\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(f(a) = [\![\alpha]\!]^{\theta[x:=a]}_\mathcal{M}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\theta[x:=a]\)</span> is that variable assignment <span class="math inline">\(\theta'\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(\theta'(x) = a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\theta'(y) = \theta(y)\)</span> for each <span class="math inline">\(y \neq x\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that the left-hand side of the equality statement in (3) involves term concatenation (function<em>al</em> application), whereas the right-hand side involves real function application in the strict sense.</p>
<p>In other words, <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> of type <span class="math inline">\((\sigma \to \tau)\)</span> is a lambda term whose denotation is a function that maps (elements of the domain of) <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>-type things to (elements of the domain of) <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span>-type things.</p>
<p>Carpenter goes on to give the usual axioms for the simply typed lamda calculus (<span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>-, <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>-, and <span class="math inline">\(\eta\)</span>-reduction schemata) and the usual rules of inference (reflexivity, transitivity, congruence, and equivalence) and to prove that the resulting system is both sound and complete.</p>
<h3 id="product-and-sum-types">Product and Sum Types</h3>
<p>The latter part of the chapter adds product and sum types to the system. Product types allow functional terms to take multiple arguments at one time (in a certain sense), while sum types introduce functional terms that can act polymorphically.</p>
<h2 id="exercise-list-types">Exercise: List Types</h2>
<p>Let me now turn to the actual exercise.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Consider adding <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^*\)</span> for lists of objects of type <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>. What would the terms look like in this scheme and how are they interpreted and treated proof-theoretically? Is there any gain in expressive power by admitting arbitrary lists? What might we do to interpret infinite sequences?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this post, I’ll only address the first two questions: what do list terms look like, and how are they interpreted. For my answer, I’ll be borrowing from the functional programming language Haskell.</p>
<h3 id="lists-in-haskell">Lists in Haskell</h3>
<p>In Haskell, lists are things like <code>[3, 5, 0]</code>, <code>["hello", "world"]</code>, etc. The order of list elements is important, and list elements can repeat. In that sense, lists are more like tuples (sequences) than sets, except that whereas a tuple (both in Haskell and in Carpenter’s section on product types) can contain objects of all different types, list elements must all be of the <em>same</em> type. For example, in Haskell, <code>(3, "hello")</code> is a possible pair, consisting of an integer and a string, but <code>[3, "hello"]</code> is not a possible list.</p>
<p>In Haskell, the list type is written as <code>[a]</code>, where <code>a</code> is any type. For example, <code>[3, 5, 0]</code> has type <code>[Int]</code>, while <code>["hello", "world"]</code> has type <code>[String]</code>. (NB: In Haskell a string is itself a list of characters, i.e. <code>String</code> is just a type synonym for <code>[Char]</code>.)</p>
<p>Note that Haskell overloads the symbols <code>[]</code>: they are used to construct both terms (Haskell expressions) and types.</p>
<p>I’ll follow Haskell’s lead by writing <span class="math inline">\([\sigma]\)</span> instead of Carpenter’s <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^*\)</span> for the type of lists containing <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>-type objects, and I’ll similarly overload the symbols <span class="math inline">\([\ ]\)</span>.</p>
<h3 id="syntax-1">Syntax</h3>
<p>I begin by adding <span class="math inline">\([\sigma]\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{Typ}\)</span>. I do so by adding the following clause to the definition of types:</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(\sigma \in \mathbf{Typ}\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\([\sigma] \in \mathbf{Typ}\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>So <span class="math inline">\([\ ]\)</span> is a unary type constructor (it takes a single type and returns a new type), whereas <span class="math inline">\(\to\)</span> is a binary type constructor (it takes two types and returns a new type).</p>
<p>As for terms, I assume that for each list type <span class="math inline">\(\tau = [\sigma]\)</span> there is a set <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{Var}_\tau\)</span> of variables of type <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> and a set <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{Con}_\tau\)</span> of constants of type <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span>. We now need a way to construct arbitrary list terms (similar to how abstraction lets us construct functional terms).</p>
<h4 id="haskell-detour">Haskell Detour</h4>
<p>In Haskell, there are two list constructors: <code>[]</code>, or <em>nil</em> (the empty list), and <code>(:)</code>, or <em>cons</em>. The cons operator has the following type signature:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="ot">(:) ::</span> a <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> [a] <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> [a]</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This means it takes something of type <code>a</code> and something of type <code>[a]</code> and returns something of type <code>[a]</code>. More precisely, it takes an <code>a</code>-type object—call it <code>x</code>— and a list of <code>a</code>-type objects—call it <code>list</code>—and it returns a new list, <code>list'</code>, whose elements are <code>x</code> followed by the elements of <code>list</code>. In other words, cons prepends its first argument (an object of type <code>a</code>) to the beginning of its second argument (a list of objects of type <code>a</code>). (Of course, in Haskell a pure function always returns a new object; it doesn’t modify objects given as arguments, so cons does not <em>literally</em> prepend anything to a given list, unlike, say, <code>list.insert(0, x)</code> in Python.)</p>
<p>For example, to construct a list of integers (objects of type <code>Int</code>), we start with <code>[]</code> of type <code>[Int]</code>, and using <code>(:)</code> we add to the front of <code>[]</code> an integer like <code>0</code> to obtain <code>(:) 0 []</code>, or using infix notation, <code>0 : []</code>. The result is of type <code>[Int]</code> and is normally written as <code>[0]</code>, which hides the cons operator. From <code>[0]</code> we can obtain <code>5 : [0]</code>, written <code>[5, 0]</code>, and from that we can obtain <code>3 : [5, 0]</code>, or <code>[3, 5, 0]</code>, and so on.</p>
<p>More generally, <code>[x1, x2, ..., xN]</code> is syntactic sugar for <code>x1 : ( x2 : ( ... ( xN : [] ) ... ) )</code>.</p>
<h4 id="back-to-terms">Back to Terms</h4>
<p>Returning to our lambda terms, we want, for each type <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>, a nil term <span class="math inline">\([\ ]\)</span> of type <span class="math inline">\([\sigma]\)</span>, and a term constructor for adding an object of type <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> to a list of type <span class="math inline">\([\sigma]\)</span> to produce a new such list. I do so by adding the following clauses to the definition of the set <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{Term}_\tau\)</span> of terms of type <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span>.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(\tau = [\sigma]\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\([\ ] \in \mathbf{Term}_\tau\)</span>.</li>
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(\tau = [\sigma]\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\alpha \in \mathbf{Term}_\sigma\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta \in \mathbf{Term}_\tau\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\((\alpha : \beta) \in \mathbf{Term}_\tau\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Like functional application, <span class="math inline">\(:\)</span> is a binary term contructor: it takes two terms to produce a new term.</p>
<p>Following Haskell, I make the following conventions:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\([\alpha] =_\mbox{def} (\alpha : [\ ])\)</span>.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\([\alpha, \beta, \dots] =_\mbox{def} (\alpha : [\beta, \dots])\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The latter schema can be applied recursively for any list of arbitrary length. For example</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
[3, 5, 0] &amp;= (3 : [5, 0])           \\
          &amp;= (3 : (5 : [0]))        \\
          &amp;= (3 : (5 : (0 : [\ ])))
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>Since there is a one-to-one correspondence between <span class="math inline">\([\alpha, \beta, \dots, \gamma]\)</span>-looking things and <span class="math inline">\((\alpha : (\beta : (\dots (\gamma : [\ ]) \dots)))\)</span>-looking things, one might wonder if we can instead reformulate (6) as follows (in two steps).</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(\tau = [\sigma]\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\alpha \in \mathbf{Term}_\sigma\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\([\alpha] \in \mathbf{Term}_\tau\)</span>.</li>
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(\tau = [\sigma]\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\alpha \in \mathbf{Term}_\sigma\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\([\beta] \in \mathbf{Term}_\tau\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\([\alpha, \beta] \in \mathbf{Term}_\tau\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>(In other words, we can construct a singleton list from a single object, and a 2-element list from two objects.)</p>
<p>The problem is that (7) cannot be applied recursively. For example, from <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> we can obtain <span class="math inline">\([0]\)</span> by appyling (6), and from <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\([0]\)</span> we can obtain <span class="math inline">\([5,0]\)</span> by applying (7). But we cannot apply (7) to, say, <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\([5,0]\)</span> to obtain <span class="math inline">\([3,5,0]\)</span> because, although <span class="math inline">\([5,0]\)</span> is of type <span class="math inline">\([\sigma]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(5,0\)</span> is not a term of any kind, let alone one of type <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>.</p>
<p>For this reason, and for the sake of making cons explicit, I’ll stick with the first formulation of (6) above.</p>
<h3 id="semantics-1">Semantics</h3>
<p>Now that I’ve added list types and list terms to the syntax, I need to add their denotations to the model theory, and this is where I’m a bit stuck, primarily because there are several options and I don’t know which is best/normal, or which one Carpenter has in mind.</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> is of a list type, say <span class="math inline">\([\sigma]\)</span>, then the denotation of <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> is in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{Dom}_{[\sigma]}\)</span>, but what precisely is the structure of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{Dom}_{[\sigma]}\)</span>?</p>
<p>For example, functional terms denote functions, so the denotation of <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> of type <span class="math inline">\((\sigma \to \tau)\)</span> is a member of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{Dom}_{\tau}^{\mathbf{Dom}_\sigma}\)</span>, i.e. a function from <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{Dom}_\sigma\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{Dom}_\tau\)</span>. Product terms denote pairs (and more generally, tuples), so the denotation of <span class="math inline">\(\langle \alpha, \beta \rangle\)</span> of type <span class="math inline">\(\sigma \times \tau\)</span> is a member of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{Dom}_\sigma \times \mathbf{Dom}_\tau\)</span>. But what does/should a list <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> of type <span class="math inline">\([\sigma]\)</span> denote, set theoretically? A flat set, i.e. a member of the power set of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{Dom}_\sigma\)</span>? Probably not, because sets don’t care about order or repetition, whereas lists (as I’ve defined them) do. What about tuples, i.e. members of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{Dom}_\sigma \times \dots \times \mathbf{Dom}_\sigma\)</span>? Maybe, but product terms already do that. Something else? I’m not sure.</p>
<p>A concrete example might help decide. Suppose we have the type <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{Ind}\)</span> for individuals and that <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{john}, \mathbf{bill}, \mathbf{sue} \in \mathbf{Term}_\mathbf{Ind}\)</span>. Then we can create a list of these individuals, <span class="math inline">\([\mathbf{john}, \mathbf{bill}, \mathbf{sue}]\)</span>, which is of type <span class="math inline">\([\mathbf{Ind}]\)</span>. Suppose also that in some model <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{M}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{john}\)</span> denotes <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{bill}\)</span> denotes <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{sue}\)</span> denotes <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(j,b,s \in \mathbf{Dom}_\mathbf{Ind}\)</span>. Then what should the list of these three individuals denote? Probably <em>not</em> the flat set <span class="math inline">\(\{j,b,s\} \in \mbox{Pow}(\mathbf{Dom}_\mathbf{Ind})\)</span>, because then <span class="math inline">\([\mathbf{john}, \mathbf{bill}, \mathbf{sue}]\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\([\mathbf{bill}, \mathbf{john}, \mathbf{sue}]\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\([\mathbf{john}, \mathbf{bill}, \mathbf{bill}, \mathbf{sue}]\)</span> would all denote the same set (at least if we apply the most obvious denotation mapping), which is probably undesirable. One reason for introducing lists in the first place is, I assume, so they can serve as meaning representations for natural language expressions that care about order and repetition.</p>
<p>Assuming, then, that we want these three lists to denote different things, the only reasonable possibility I can think of is to map lists to tuples. For example, <span class="math inline">\([\mathbf{john}, \mathbf{bill}, \mathbf{sue}]\)</span> will denote <span class="math inline">\(\langle j,b,s \rangle\)</span>, which is an element of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{Ind} \times \mathbf{Ind} \times \mathbf{Ind}\)</span>. In this way, list terms are essentially like product terms, but with two main differences: (i) both products and lists denote tuples, but lists are composed of objects of the <em>same</em> type, meaning that the tuples they denote will contain objects from the <em>same</em> domain; and (ii) empty and singleton lists are possible, whereas empty and singleton tuples are in general (at least for Carpenter) not, as far as I can tell.</p>
<p>The following clauses get added to the definition of denotation.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(\tau = [\sigma]\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\alpha = [\ ] \in \mathbf{Term}_\tau\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\([\![\alpha]\!]^\theta_\mathcal{M} = \emptyset\)</span>.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\([\![(\alpha : \beta)]\!]^\theta_\mathcal{M} = \langle [\![\alpha]\!]^\theta_\mathcal{M}, [\![\beta]\!]^\theta_\beta \rangle\)</span>, assuming <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> are appropriately typed.</li>
</ol>
<p>Continuing the example above, <span class="math inline">\([\mathbf{john}] = (\mathbf{john} : [\ ])\)</span> denotes <span class="math inline">\(\langle j, \emptyset \rangle \in \mathbf{Dom}_\mathbf{[Ind]}\)</span>. And <span class="math inline">\([\mathbf{john}, \mathbf{bill}, \mathbf{sue}]\)</span> denotes <span class="math inline">\(\langle j, \langle b, \langle s,\emptyset \rangle \rangle \rangle \in \mathbf{Dom}_\mathbf{[Ind]}\)</span>. Rewriting tuples in the usual way (analogous to lists above), where <span class="math inline">\(\langle a,b,c, \dots \rangle =_\mbox{def} \langle a, \langle b,c, \dots \rangle \rangle\)</span>, the latter denotation becomes <span class="math inline">\(\langle j,b,s,\emptyset \rangle\)</span>.</p>
<p>So what is the structure of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{Dom}_\mathbf{[Ind]}\)</span>? It’s a set whose members are tuples, of varying size, consisting of individuals (except the last tuple member, which is always <span class="math inline">\(\emptyset\)</span> except in the case of the empty tuple).</p>
<p>More generally, <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{Dom}_{[\sigma]}\)</span> is a set whose members are tuples, of varying size, consisting of elements from <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{Dom}_\sigma\)</span>.</p>
<p>This is different from the case of products: the domain of intepretation for, say, a pair of terms <span class="math inline">\(\langle \alpha,\beta \rangle\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{Dom}_\sigma \times \mathbf{Dom}_\tau\)</span>, which contains only pairs, not tuples of any other size; and the domain of interpretation for, say, a triple of terms <span class="math inline">\(\langle \alpha,\beta,\gamma \rangle\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{Dom}_\sigma \times \mathbf{Dom}_\tau \times \mathbf{Dom}_\rho\)</span>, which contains only triples, not tuples of any other size. Hence, whereas, say, <span class="math inline">\([\alpha, \beta]\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\([\alpha, \beta, \gamma]\)</span> have denotations in the same domain, <span class="math inline">\(\langle \alpha,\beta \rangle\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\langle \alpha,\beta,\gamma \rangle\)</span> do not.</p>
<p>I’ll conclude by mentioning that it’s kind of weird to use <span class="math inline">\(\emptyset\)</span> in the denotation of lists, but this is necessary because the denotation function is a total function, and since the empty list, <span class="math inline">\([\ ]\)</span>, is a term, it requires a denotation. If <span class="math inline">\([\ ]\)</span> is of type <span class="math inline">\([\sigma]\)</span>, it doesn’t make sense for its denotation to include anything from <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{Dom}_\sigma\)</span>, so we’re stuck with having it denote something like <span class="math inline">\(\emptyset\)</span>.</p>
<p>One way to avoid this would be to redefine lists: empty lists are simply not possible terms (objects). The smallest list would then be a singleton list, which would denote a <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>-tuple, so <span class="math inline">\([\mathbf{john}]\)</span> would denote <span class="math inline">\(\langle j \rangle\)</span> rather than <span class="math inline">\(\langle j,\emptyset \rangle\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\([\mathbf{john}, \mathbf{bill}, \mathbf{sue}]\)</span> would denote <span class="math inline">\(\langle j,b,s \rangle\)</span> rather than <span class="math inline">\(\langle j,b,s,\emptyset \rangle\)</span>.</p>
