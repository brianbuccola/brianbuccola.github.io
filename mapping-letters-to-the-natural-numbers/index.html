    <section>
        <p>It’s the end of the fall semester, and I have one last final exam problem to grade for the semantics class I’m TAing for. Actually, it’s the first problem on the exam, but I saved it till last because nearly every student seems to have gotten it totally wrong. Which is surprising, given that the problem revolves around one of the first concepts the students learned, a concept that is central to formal semantics: generating and interpreting expressions in some suitable way. What’s more, they even saw the converse (so to speak) of this problem on the midterm.</p>
<p>The problem says to use the symbols <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> to generate a set of expressions that denote all and only the natural numbers (i.e., the set of non-negative integers) and to do so without any natural number being named more than once. In other words, provide syntactic formation rules for generating infinitely many expressions from just those five letters, and provide semantic valuation rules for mapping those expressions onto the natural numbers, such that each expression corresponds to exactly one natural number, and each natural number is the correspondent of exactly one expression, i.e., an isomorphism between the set of <span class="math inline">\(abcde\)</span>-expressions and the set of natural numbers. (The problem on the midterm was the converse: to decide whether the set of expressions formed, in some given way, from the four letters <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> were, under some given valuation rules, isomorphic to the natural numbers.)</p>
<p>The spirit of the problem, I think, is to use all and only the (mutually distinct) letters <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span>. However, in principle the problem can be solved using just one letter.</p>
<p>For example, let <span class="math inline">\(L = \{a\}\)</span>. Then we can generate an infinite set <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> of expressions with the following recursive formation rules.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><span class="math inline">\(a \in E\)</span>.</li>
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(x \in E\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(xa \in E\)</span>.</li>
<li>Nothing else is a member of <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Rule 2 is essentially a suffixation rule. Thus, <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> contains the expressions <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(aa\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(aaa\)</span>, etc., where we suffix a single <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> to any already well-formed expression to generate a new well-formed expression. We can interpret these expressions with the following valuation rules.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><span class="math inline">\(v(a) = 0\)</span>.</li>
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(x \in E\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(xa = v(x) + 1\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thus, for example, we have the following valuations.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
v(a)   &amp;= 0 \\
v(aa)  &amp;= v(a) + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1 \\
v(aaa) &amp;= v(aa) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 \\
       &amp;\ldots
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>And in general, <span class="math inline">\(v(a^n) = n-1\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(a^n\)</span> is shorthand for the expression consisting of exactly <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> occurrences of <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>. Clearly, these valuation rules make the set <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> isomorphic to the set of natural numbers: each expression in <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> correpsonds to exactly one natural number, and each natural number is in turn the correspondent of (is expressible by) exactly one expression in <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>.</p>
<p>But this language isn’t all that interesting. More interesting are the languages formed from two or more letters. For example, let <span class="math inline">\(L = \{a, b\}\)</span> and consider the following formation rules.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(x \in L\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(x \in E\)</span>.</li>
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(x \in E\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(x \neq a\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(y \in L\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(xy \in E\)</span>.</li>
<li>Nothing else is a member of <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Again, rule 2 is a suffixation rule, with the stipulation that nothing can be suffixed to <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>. (We’ll see why in a moment.) Thus, <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> contains the expressions <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(ba\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(bb\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(baa\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(bab\)</span>, etc., but <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> does not contain the expressions <span class="math inline">\(aa\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(ab\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(aba\)</span>, etc. The reason for excluding these latter expressions should become clear from the following valuation rules.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><span class="math inline">\(v(a) = 0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(v(b) = 1\)</span>.</li>
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(x \in E\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(x \neq a\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(y \in L\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(v(xy) = 2 \cdot v(x) + v(y)\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Since <span class="math inline">\(v(a) = 0\)</span>, if <span class="math inline">\(aa\)</span> were a well-formed expression, i.e., if the condition “<span class="math inline">\(x \neq a\)</span>” were removed, then the valuation of <span class="math inline">\(aa\)</span> would be the same as that of <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>. That is, the valuation rules would fail to make <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> isomorphic to the set of natural numbers because there would be at least one natural number, namely <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>, that has more than one correspondent in <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>. (<span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> would be expressible by more than one <span class="math inline">\(abcde\)</span>-expression.)</p>
<p>Continuing on, we have the following valuations.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
v(a)    &amp;= 0 \\
v(b)    &amp;= 1 \\
v(ba)   &amp;= 2 \cdot v(b) + v(a) = 2 \cdot 1 + 0 = 2 \\
v(bb)   &amp;= 2 \cdot v(b) + v(b) = 2 \cdot 1 + 1 = 3 \\
v(baa)  &amp;= 2 \cdot v(ba) + v(a) = 2 \cdot 2 + 0 = 4 \\
v(bab)  &amp;= 2 \cdot v(ba) + v(b) = 2 \cdot 2 + 1 = 5 \\
        &amp;\ldots
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>This language, and its interpretation, should look familiar: it’s binary, except we’ve replaced <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>. The following table shows the expressions of <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>, the corresponding expressions in binary, and the corresponding expressions in decimal; and of course by “corresponding” expressions we mean expressions whose valuations are the same natural number.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
L=\{a,b\} &amp;&amp; \text{Binary} &amp;&amp; \text{Decimal} \\
a         &amp;&amp; 0             &amp;&amp; 0 \\
b         &amp;&amp; 1             &amp;&amp; 1 \\
ba        &amp;&amp; 10            &amp;&amp; 2 \\
bb        &amp;&amp; 11            &amp;&amp; 3 \\
baa       &amp;&amp; 100           &amp;&amp; 4 \\
bab       &amp;&amp; 101           &amp;&amp; 5 \\
bba       &amp;&amp; 110           &amp;&amp; 6 \\
bbb       &amp;&amp; 111           &amp;&amp; 7 \\
baaa      &amp;&amp; 1000          &amp;&amp; 8 \\
\ldots    &amp;&amp; \ldots        &amp;&amp; \ldots
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>From here it’s easy to see that the solution to the problem, with <span class="math inline">\(L = \{a,b,c,d,e\}\)</span>, amounts to devising a base-5 language. I won’t write down the answer here, just in case some student stumbles on this post, but extending the binary, or two-letter, case is pretty straightforward.</p>
