    <section>
        <p>For many years, I used <a href="https://www.jwz.org/xscreensaver/">XScreenSaver</a> as my trusty screen saver and screen locker for the X window system. Although I really enjoyed the many different screen savers that it came with (I’ll never forget my students’ reaction when one day in class my slides turned into a cow jumping on a trampoline), I recently decided that I wanted something a bit more minimal (and less embarrassment-prone). Here’s what I wanted:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>When in console (i.e. not in X), the screen should go blank (i.e. turn off, not just turn black) after <strong>1 minute</strong> of activity.</p></li>
<li><p>When in X, the screen should go blank <em>and lock</em> after <strong>10 minutes</strong> of inactivity.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The reason for switching from a screen saver to a blank screen in X is mainly to conserve battery life.</p>
<p>The reason for not requiring a screen lock in console is simply because I personally almost never spend time in console (I always start X right away), so it’s really not an issue. I simply want it to go blank in case, for example, I boot up my computer, walk away to make a coffee, etc., and forget about it for a while. In that case, I haven’t logged in yet, so my console screen is already password-protected.</p>
<p>For the impatient: just jump to the <a href="#recap">recap</a> to see my setup.</p>
<h2 id="console-setup">Console setup</h2>
<p>To make the screen go blank in console after, say, 60 seconds, you just need to pass the option <code>consoleblank=60</code> to the kernel, e.g. by adding this option as a kernel parameter in your boot loader configuration file. I use <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/syslinux">Syslinux</a> as my boot loader, so for me, I simply edit the file</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="ex">/boot/syslinux/syslinux.cfg</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>so that the line</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="ex">APPEND</span> root=/dev/sda1 rw</span></code></pre></div>
<p>becomes</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="ex">APPEND</span> root=/dev/sda1 rw consoleblank=60</span></code></pre></div>
<p>If you use GRUB, you would do the same thing but edit the GRUB configuration file. See <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Kernel_parameters">here</a> for more info about passing options to the kernel.</p>
<h2 id="x-setup">X setup</h2>
<p>Recall that in X we want to do two things after 10 minutes of activity: blank the screen <em>and</em> lock the screen. These are two separate things.</p>
<h3 id="blanking-the-screen">Blanking the screen</h3>
<p>To blank the screen, we use the <code>xset</code> command. First, let me mention that running <code>xset q</code> lists all the current settings—try that now and look at the output before reading further. The important sections are “Screen Saver” and “DPMS”.</p>
<p>Now then, the <code>s</code> option lets you set screen saver parameters. For example,</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="fu">xset</span> s 600</span></code></pre></div>
<p>activates the “screen saver” after 600 seconds (10 minutes). For me, activating the “screen saver” is equivalent to blanking the screen—you can test this by running <code>xset s 1</code> and waiting 1 second— so this single command does the job we want. (NB: 600 seconds is also the default, so <code>xset s</code> would also work; it also resets any previous screen saver setting, such as <code>xset s 1</code> above.)</p>
<p>You can also use DPMS (Energy Star) features with the <code>dpms</code> option. There are several DPMS states:</p>
<ul>
<li>standby</li>
<li>suspend</li>
<li>off</li>
<li>on</li>
</ul>
<p>For me, standby, suspend, and off are all equivalent to blanking the screen, but I guess on some computers they will do different things. You can test them yourself by running, for example,</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="fu">xset</span> dpms force standby</span></code></pre></div>
<p>To force standby, suspend, and off modes after 300s, 400s, and 500s, respectively, run</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb6-1"><a href="#cb6-1" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="fu">xset</span> dpms 300 400 500</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Once you figure out the command that you want, just add it to your X startup file, <code>~/.xinitrc</code>, to run the command whenever you start X.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Display_Power_Management_Signaling">here</a> for more info, as well as, of course, <code>man xset</code>.</p>
<h3 id="locking-the-screen">Locking the screen</h3>
<p>To lock the screen, first we need a screen locking program. I’ve tried several <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/List_of_applications#Screen_lockers">screen lockers</a>, and my favorite is <a href="http://tools.suckless.org/slock/">slock</a>, for one main reason: it’s super minimal. There is no login prompt or anything. The screen simply turns black when it locks. When you start typing your password, the screen turns blue. If you press <code>&lt;Enter&gt;</code> and the password was incorrect, it turns red. Start typing again, and it turns blue again. In other words, you only see three possible things: a black screen, a blue screen, or a red screen. I like that. It would thoroughly confuse anyone trying to mess with your computer.</p>
<p>Use your package manager to download slock, and then try it out by running <code>slock</code> in the terminal. Try out other <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/List_of_applications#Screen_lockers">screen lockers</a>, too, if you like. (Note that one advantage of some other lockers, such as sflock and physlock, is that they block access to other TTYs, but I don’t care too much about this functionality since I never have other sessions open on other TTYs.)</p>
<p>Once you’re satisfied that slock works and you like it (or once you pick a different locker), you can use the <code>xautolock</code> command to run <code>slock</code> every 10 minutes by adding this command to your <code>~/.xnitrc</code>.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb7"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb7-1"><a href="#cb7-1" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="ex">xautolock</span> -time 10 -locker slock <span class="kw">&amp;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>(If you decided on a different locker, just replace <code>slock</code> with your locker’s name, e.g. <code>physlock</code>.)</p>
<p>Note the <code>&amp;</code> at the end, which runs the command in the background. If you omit this, then the other commands in your <code>~/.xinitrc</code> (such as the one that starts your window manager) won’t get executed, which is a problem.</p>
<p>That’s it!</p>
<h2 id="recap">Recap</h2>
<p>To recap, we did three things:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Added the kernel parameter <code>consoleblank=60</code> to blank the screen in console after 1 minute.</p></li>
<li><p>Added the command <code>xset s</code> (or similar) to <code>~/.xinitrc</code> to blank the screen in X after 10 minutes.</p></li>
<li><p>Added the command <code>xautolock -time 10 -locker slock &amp;</code> (or similar) to <code>~/.xinitrc</code> to lock the screen in X after 10 minutes.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that, without the <code>xautolock</code> command, the screen would simply go blank, with no lock protection. Conversely, without the <code>xset s</code> command, the screen would lock but not go blank (i.e, off); it would go black but still be on. By blanking and locking, we save battery life and increase security.</p>
