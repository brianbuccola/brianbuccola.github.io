    <section>
        <p>I just spent several hours troubleshooting a number of problems I encountered while trying to submit the LaTeX source files of a forthcoming manuscript to a journal hosted by Manuscript Central / ScholarOne (<em>Journal of Semantics</em>). Since I (and/or others) will likely encounter these (or similar) problems in the future, I figured I’d document my solutions to the two problems that gave me the most trouble, plus my failure to solve a third problem. Given also my <a href="../how-to-force-pdflatex-pdf-over-latex-dvi-compilation/">previous post</a>, this may turn into a series of posts…</p>
<p><strong>Pro-tip:</strong> The first step is always to inspect the log file produced by the compilation. In my case, I saw that the journal’s version of TeX Live is from 2013 — 6 years old! This turned out to be the source of both problems below.</p>
<h2 id="fixing-old-versions-of-tex-live-with-fixltx2e">1. Fixing old versions of TeX Live with fixltx2e</h2>
<p>The first problem was that I kept getting an error regarding my use of <code>\textsubscript</code>. It took me longer than I care to admit to just google the issue. The first result was <a href="https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/1013/how-to-typeset-subscript-in-usual-text-mode">this Stack Exchange thread</a>, which reveals that before 2015, you needed to use the <code>fixltx2e</code> package to properly use <code>\textsubscript</code>. So I added</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode latex"><code class="sourceCode latex"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="co">% Fix LaTeX2e (needed for JoS's 2013 version of TeX Live)</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="bu">\usepackage</span>{<span class="ex">fixltx2e</span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>to my preamble.</p>
<p>If you’re using an up-to-date version of TeX Live, this will produce a warning letting you know that you don’t need this package anymore.</p>
<h2 id="using-a-package-that-the-journal-doesnt-have">2. Using a package that the journal doesn’t have</h2>
<p>The second problem was that the journal doesn’t have the <a href="https://ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/generic/expex"><em>ExPex</em></a> package. (This package was only written in 2014, a year after the journal’s version of TeX Live, and only available as part of TeX Live since 2017.)</p>
<p>In theory, this shouldn’t pose a huge problem, because the journal allows you to upload “supplementary TeX/LaTeX files” — meaning you can just upload the source files to any package that’s missing.</p>
<p>In the case of <em>ExPex</em>, those files would be:</p>
<pre><code>expex.sty
expex.tex
epltxfn.sty</code></pre>
<p>(<code>expex.sty</code> is just a wrapper for <code>expex.tex</code>. There’s also <code>epltxchapno.sty</code>, but that’s for works with chapters.)</p>
<p>The problem I encountered was that the journal was trying to convert <code>expex.tex</code> to a PDF, which was producing a bunch of errors — because that file isn’t intended to be converted into a PDF — and the system won’t let you complete submission if there are any unconverted TeX files.</p>
<p>On a hunch, I renamed <code>expex.tex</code> to <code>expex</code> (i.e. I removed the extension). Thankfully…</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The journal didn’t complain much. (It did give me a warning about no extension, but it let me continue anyway.)</li>
<li>It no longer tried to convert <code>expex</code> to PDF.</li>
<li>The missing <em>ExPex</em> package worked seamlessly even with the missing <code>.tex</code> extension on the main file.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="re-running-biber-or-bibtex-to-fix-citations">3. Re-running Biber (or BibTeX) to fix citations</h2>
<p>This is something I <em>couldn’t</em> solve: although the system produced a PDF, it didn’t produce proper citations, or print a bibliography. Usually, this means that Biber (or BibTeX) needs to be re-run, but I couldn’t force the system to do that from my end.</p>
<p>The problem could be because I use Biblatex/Biber instead of the traditional BibTeX. I tried forcing the Biber backend by <a href="https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/78101/when-and-why-should-i-use-tex-ts-program-and-tex-encoding">adding the directive</a></p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode latex"><code class="sourceCode latex"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="co">% !BIB TS-program = biber</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>to the top of the TeX file, but that didn’t work. (This is apparently only for TeX Shop, which I guess the journal doesn’t use. I’m not sure if there’s a more general directive, or a directive for <code>latexmk</code>, similar to the <code>%&amp;pdflatex</code> directive that I discussed in my <a href="../how-to-force-pdflatex-pdf-over-latex-dvi-compilation/">previous post</a>.)</p>
<p>The problem could also be because the journal uses plain <code>pdflatex</code> rather than something like <code>latexmk</code>, which takes care of Biber/Biblatex and multiple compilations.</p>
<p>In any case, I was able to complete my submission (along with my own PDF, with all the citations and bibliography), because of the solutions to the first two problems.</p>
