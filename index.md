Welcome!
I'm an Assistant Professor of linguistics
at [Michigan State University][msu].
I specialize in
formal and experimental semantics and pragmatics.
This means I use math and logic
to model how humans
transmit thoughts back and forth,
often using experimental methods along the way
to help refine the models.

Specific research topics include
numerical expressions,
distributivity and collectivity,
plurality,
questions,
ignorance and grammar,
and competition in human language and beyond.

Before coming to MSU,
I was a postdoctoral researcher
at the [Laboratoire de Sciences Cognitives et Psycholinguistique][lscp],
a [CNRS][cnrs] lab,
at the [École Normale Supérieure][ens] in Paris.
Before that,
I was a postdoctoral fellow
at the [Language, Logic and Cognition Center][llcc]
at the [Hebrew University of Jerusalem][huji].
I completed my PhD in linguistics at [McGill University][mcgill].

Apart from linguistics,
I enjoy tinkering with Linux,
lifting things,
and brewing beer.
