        <p>This is just a bookmark to remind myself to use <a href="http://yalerecord.org/2016/10/26/the-yale-record-does-not-endorse-hillary-clinton/">this wonderful little article by The Yale Record</a> next time I teach pragmatics.</p>
<p>Here is the full text:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In its 144-year history, The Yale Record has never endorsed a Democratic candidate for president. In fact, we have never endorsed any candidate for president. This is, in part, due to our strong commitment to being a tax-exempt 501(c)3 organization, which mandates that we are “absolutely prohibited from directly or indirectly participating in, or intervening in, any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for elective public office.”</p>
<p>This year’s presidential election is highly unusual, but ultimately no different: The Yale Record believes both candidates to be equally unendorsable, due to our faithful compliance with the tax code.</p>
<p>In particular, we do not endorse Hillary Clinton’s exemplary leadership during her 30 years in the public eye. We do not support her impressive commitment to serving and improving this country—a commitment to which she has dedicated her entire professional career. Because of unambiguous tax law, we do not encourage you to support the most qualified presidential candidate in modern American history, nor do we encourage all citizens to shatter the glass ceiling once and for all by electing Secretary Clinton on November 8.</p>
<p>The Yale Record has no opinion whatsoever on Dr. Jill Stein.</p>
<p>—The Editorial Board of The Yale Record</p>
